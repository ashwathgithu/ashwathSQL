# This repository contains a SQL analysis project focused on a dataset related to books. The goal of this project is to perform various SQL queries and analyses on the dataset to extract meaningful insights about the books, authors, genres, and other relevant information.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information about books, including details such as title, author, publication year, genre, and ratings.
## Files

- dataset.csv: The raw dataset in CSV format.
- schema.sql: SQL schema file containing the table structure for importing the dataset into a SQL database.
- analysis_queries.sql: SQL queries for performing various analyses on the dataset.

## Analysis

The analysis conducted in this project covers several aspects of the book dataset, including:

- Total number of books in the dataset
- Distribution of books by genre
- Top-rated books
- Authors with the most books
- Average rating by genre
- Publication trends over the years

## Getting Started

To replicate the analysis:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Import the dataset into your SQL database.
3. Execute the SQL queries in schema.sql to create the necessary tables.
4. Execute the SQL queries in analysis_queries.sql to perform the analysis.

## Requirements

- SQL database management system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)
- SQL client for executing queries
